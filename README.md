Most of the backend logic is in place, but I’m now focused on developing the frontend, particularly the playback controls that will allow users to play songs. The app currently supports creating new jukebox sessions, where a host generates a Party session code (similar to Kahoot), and users join by entering this code. Users can add songs to the session queue, but I’m working on adding playback controls so the host can manage the music. All backend data is currently stored using MongoDB.
